# Creating_Rectangles
Write a program that will manipulate Rectangle objects for which you will create a Rectangle class

Design a class named Rectangle to represent a rectangle. The class contains..
2 double data fields named width and height that specify the width and height of the rectangle
a no-arg constructor that creates a default rectangle with width 1 and height 1
a constructor that creates a rectangle with specified width and height
accessor and mutator functions for all data fields
a function named getArea() that returns the area of the rectangle
a function named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter of the rectangle
Create the UML diagram with text in the Algorithm area of your submission.
Implement the class
Write a test program that creates 2 Rectangle objects.
Display the properties of both objects, and their areas and perimeters.
